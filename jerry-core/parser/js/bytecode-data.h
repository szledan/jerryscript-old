 * All literals are kept in the 'literals' array.

 * are kept in the 'strings_buffer' and literal has pointer to this buffer.
 *
 * Literal id is its index in 'literals' array of bytecode_data_t structure.
 *
 * Bytecode, which is kept in the 'opcodes' field, is divided into blocks
 * of 'BLOCK_SIZE' operands. Every block has its own numbering of literals.
 * Literal uid could be in range [0, 127] in every block.
 *
 * To map uid to literal id 'lit_id_hash' table is used.
